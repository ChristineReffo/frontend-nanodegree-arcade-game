## Description

The Arcade Game 'Frogger' is an interactive game, where the player - the pink-haired character at the bottom of the canvas - needs to make her way to the water without running into the enemy bugs. These bugs run across the path in varying speeds, which makes the crossing difficult. At the point of collision, the player is reset to her initial position.

## Instructions


Move the player with the arrow keys 'up', 'down', 'left' and 'right'.

The goal is to reach the water without running into the bug enemies.
